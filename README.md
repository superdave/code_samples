Code Samples
============

This repository contains samples of code that I've personally written in
several different languages.  Some code comes from team projects I've been on,
but all code has been sanitized to avoid copying of proprietary code or code
written by others.  All work is 100% mine.


Projects
========

A brief overview of each directory follows; more details are in README files
within the project directories themselves.


-BLAM-
------

This is a 2D game engine I started developing in my spare time in 2009 for Mac
OS X which I used as a display engine for a research project in graduate
school.  It features Objective-C++-to-C++ bridging, Lua scripting, and OpenGL
sprite manipulation with PNG sprite loading.  It builds on XCode 7 on Mac OS X
10.11, at least, possibly older ones.


Secret Santa
------------

This is an example of a very quick utilitarian piece of code written in Python;
its primary purpose was to solve the problem of drawing names for the family
Secret Santa exchange while making sure people in nuclear families did not get
each other.  It was written and tested within the hour that some members of the
family were attempting to perform the draw with paper.


Sudoku
------

This was the final project for my undergraduate algorithms class in 2005 (yes,
it's old, but a useful example of algorithmic analysis, data structures and
optimization).  It is in C++, which would probably not be my preferred language
for anything in the enterprise today without good reason (no compile-time or
run-time enforced bounds/reference checking, etc.; too vulnerable without a lot
of code review and auditing).  I'd love to try rewriting this in Rust some time
soon.

Code Samples
============

This repository contains samples of code that I've personally written in
several different languages.  Some code comes from team projects I've been on,
but all code has been sanitized to avoid copying of proprietary code or code
written by others.  All work is 100% mine.


Projects
========

A brief overview of each directory follows; more details are in README files
within the project directories themselves.


Secret Santa
------------

This is an example of a very quick utilitarian piece of code written in Python;
its primary purpose was to solve the problem of drawing names for the family
Secret Santa exchange while making sure people in nuclear families did not get
each other.  It was written and tested within the hour that some members of the
family were attempting to perform the draw with paper.
